# ansible-vagrant-elk

## What is this?

Ansible playbook that I built for vagrant. Used for learning ansible and vagrant. Built from scratch on an Ubuntu 16.04 desktop installation but it should be the same on any system.

## Still left to finish

1. Add logstash role
2. Add nginx role
3. Add some testing
4. Add kibana handlers
